# Linux Top Command With Java 1.8
   
   
    
    
 This is a java application that shows you the output of the "  top " command in Linux differently .
    
    

# Getting started

  As you might have already know, you simply need to type this in the terminal to launch top: 

```sh
top
```
And what you would get is :

But by using Java to execute this command, we actually can manipulate the output and calculate the percentage of the memory used so, we get something like this :

# What You Need To Install


Install the java JDK using this command : 

```sh
sudo apt install default-JDK
```

After setting up the JDK, you can compile the topCommand.java file using this command :

```sh
javac topCommand.java
```

Finally, run it with :

```sh
java topCommand
```
